# GT Themed Crossy Road

Developers: Phillip Phanhthourath, Niti Mirkhelkar, Tia Kungwani, and Veena Gonugondla.

This project is a GT themed version of the classic retro game concept of Frogger. 
The player controls Buzz to help him cross the road and river safely.
If the player finishes a round, they will be greeted with a "Gameover!" message.
Avoid the cars and water in order to keep Buzz out of danger!
